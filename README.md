# Tinkersynth

An experimental art project that lets users create generative art through serendipitous, whimsical experimentation.

> NOTE: This repository is a copy of https://github.com/joshwcomeau/tinkersynth, migrated from Gatsby 2/Flow to Next 16/TypeScript. I did not put any care into this migration; the goal was to get it working at any cost, in terms of maintainability or code quality. Type checking has been disabled in many files. The original repository may be of higher quality.

## License

This code is released without license. I hope that you'll read the source to answer any questions you have and take that knowledge to your own projects, rather than forking and augmenting Tinkersynth itself.

(Of course you're more than welcome to try modifying the code for your own curiosity! Just please don't publish it, or try to monetize it).
